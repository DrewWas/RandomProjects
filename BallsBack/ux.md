# What is the experience??

# Can it double as a bucket??
   - Yeah, it can and it needs to. Otherwise it would be too hard to market

 * There cannot be any mechanism ON TOP of the bucket that draws in the upper triangle 
- Balls would land on it and fuck it up 
	* Because of this, the handle has to lie on an actual side of the triangle such that when it is in the goal, nothing is 'on top' of the catching mesh and lower triangle


# Can't be made of bullshit materials 
   - People will think it's cheap

   - Netting needs to be nylon **** This is so that when it rains and
     shit gets wet, it stays taught. Other materials (string, mesh,
etc.) lose their taughtness when they get wet 
	* This can be a marketting point



##### Theres a lot we could do with this 

* Once design is solid -- NEED A PATENT!!

# One of those basketball things that goes under the hoop and catches the ball and passes it back -- but for lax (dont think this would be all that hard)
	* Could also do this with hockey - think just a little thing at the bottom of the cage that pushes the puck back out at you 
		* This would prob be easier to engineer tbh (think pinball machine)
			* This would need some type of battery tho
